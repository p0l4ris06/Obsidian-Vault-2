### Lipids 2: phospholipids and cholesterol
[[Phospholipid]]s have the same structure as [[Triglycerides]] except that one of the fatty acids is replaced with a [[Phosphate group]]
A [[Condensation reaction]] between an OH group on the phosphoric acid molecule and one of the three OH groups on the glycerol forms an [[Ester bond]]
The head of a phospholipid is [[Hydrophilic]] and the tail is [[Hydrophobic]] 
Together these make up the [[Phospholipid bilayer]]
[[Cholesterol]]
