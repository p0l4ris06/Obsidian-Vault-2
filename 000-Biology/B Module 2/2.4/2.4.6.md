[[Concentration]] 
![[Pasted image 20230728135439.png]]
[[Vmax]]
As substrate is added and its [[Concentration]] increases, the [[rate of reaction]] increases.
- This is because more [[Enzyme]]-[[Substrate]] complexes form
- As a result, more products are formed
- Substrate concentration is the limiting factor
