### The effect of enzyme concentration on the rate of reaction 
[[Enzyme]] [[Concentration]] is the limiting factor at the beginning of the reaction.
If the [[Substrate]] concentration is increased, the rate of reaction will increase. 
If enzyme concentration is increased further, the [[rate of reaction]] will not change, as there is a fixed concentration of substrate. Substrate concentration becomes the limiting factor
