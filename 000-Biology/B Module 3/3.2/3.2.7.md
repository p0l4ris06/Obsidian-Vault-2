[[Haemoglobin]]
Dissociation of haemoglobin and oxygen occurs in the tissues where *p*O<sub>2</sub> is low
Association of haemoglobin and oxygen occurs in the lungs where *p*O<sub>2</sub> is high
The ability of haemoglobin to associate with and release oxygen depends on the concentration of oxygen in the surrounding tissues, measured by *p*O<sub>2</sub>, the partial pressure of oxygen
