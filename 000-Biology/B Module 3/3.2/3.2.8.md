### Transport of [[Carbon dioxide]]
[[Carbonic anhydrase]]
[[Chloride shift]]
[[Bohr effect]]
[[Haemoglobinic acid]]

##### Role of [[Haemoglobin]]
- 5% of [[Carbon dioxide]] is dissolved directly into the [[Plasma]]
- 10% is combined directly with haemoglobin to form a compound called carbaminohaemoglobin
- 85% is transported in the form of hydrogencarbonate ions

[[Carbon dioxide]] in the blood [[Plasma]] diffuses into the red [[Blood]] cells. Here it combines with [[Water]] to form a weak acid called carbonic acid. This reaction is catalysed by the [[Enzyme]] carbonic anhydrase. 
This carbonic acid dissociates to release hydrogen ions and hydrogencarbonate ions.
The hydrogencarbonate ions diffuse out if the red blood cell into the plasma. The charge inside the red blood cell is maintained by the chloride shift

The hydrogen ions building up in the red blood cell could cause the contents of the red blood cell to become very acidic. To prevent this, hydrogen ions are taken out of solution by associating with haemoglobin to form haemoglobinic acid
