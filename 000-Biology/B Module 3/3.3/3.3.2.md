### Transport tissues
[[Companion cells]]
[[Sieve tube elements]]

[[Xylem]]: Dead cells, contains lignin in the cell walls, keeps vessels open. Carries water and mineral ions from roots to leaves, continuous tubes, unidirectional

[[Phloem]]: Living cells, contains sieve tube elements to transport sugars and nutrients around the plant, bidirectional

[[Xylem]] and [[Phloem]] are found in vascular bundles

In the roots the vascular bundle is found in the centre and the centre core of this is [[Xylem]] tissue

In stems the vascular bundles are found around the outside and the [[Xylem]] tissue is found on the inside

The phloem is a complex tissue made up of sieve tube elements, companion cells and parenchyma

In the roots the [[Phloem]] is found on the edges of the centre core

In stems the [[Phloem]] is found around the outside of the vascular bundle
