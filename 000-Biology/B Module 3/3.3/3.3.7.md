#### Along the [[Phloem]]
- [[Water]] entering the sieve tube at the source increases the [[Hydrostatic pressure]]. Water leaving the sieve tube at the sink decreases the [[Hydrostatic pressure]]. Therefore, a pressure gradient is established along the sieve tube, and the sap flows from higher pressure to lower pressure. This could be in either direction depending on where [[Sucrose]] is being made and where it is needed
