### Secondary non-specific defences
Antigen-presenting cell: a cell that isolates the antigen from a [[Pathogen]] and places it on the [[Plasma membrane]] so that it can be recognised by other cells in the immune system
Clonal selection: selection of a specific B or T cell that is specific to the [[Antigen]]
[[Cytokines]]: hormone-like molecules used in [[Cell signalling]] to stimulate the immune response
[[Neutrophil]]
[[Opsonins]]
[[Phagocytosis]]
[[Macrophages]]
[[Clonal selection]]
[[Cell signalling]]
