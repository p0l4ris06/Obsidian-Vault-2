# The need for communication systems
## Survival and activity
All living things need to maintain a certain limited set of conditions inside their cells. These include:
- A suitable temperature
- A suitable [[pH]]
- An aqueous environment that keeps [[Substrate]]s and products in solution
- Freedom from toxins and excess inhibitors

## [[Cell signalling]]
The two major systems of communication that work by cell signalling are: 
#### The neuronal system
An interconnected network of [[Neurones]] that signal to each other across [[Synapse junction]]s. The neurones can conduct a signal very quickly and enable rapid responses to stimuli that may be changing quickly

#### The hormonal system
A system that uses [[Blood]] to transport its signals. Cells in an endocrine [[Organ]] release the signal (a hormone) directly into the blood. The hormone is transported throughout the body, but is only recognised by specific target cells. The hormonal system enables longer-term responses to be coordinated
