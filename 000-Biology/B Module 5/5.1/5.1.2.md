[[Sensory receptors]]

## Homeostasis
Aspects maintained by homeostasis may include: 
- Body temperature
- [[Blood]] [[Glucose]] [[Concentration]]
- Blood salt concentration
- [[Water potential]] of the blood
- Blood [[Pressure]] 
- [[Carbon dioxide]] concentration
## The mechanism of homeostasis
Any response in changes to the environment requires a complex mechanism, which may involve a series of tissues and [[Organ]]s that are coordinated through [[Cell signalling]]. The standard response pathway is: 
Stimulus --> receptor --> communication pathway (cell signalling) --> effector --> response
