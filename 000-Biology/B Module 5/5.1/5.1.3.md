[[Ectotherm]]
[[Endotherm]]

## Temperature control in ectotherms
If ectotherms are not warm enough they try to absorb more heat from the environment. They may:
- Move to a sunny area
- Lie on a warm surface
- Expose a larger surface area to the sun

If ectotherms are too hot they try to avoid gaining more heat and try to increase heat loss to the environment. They may:
- Move out of the sun
- Move underground
- Reduce the body surface exposed to the sun
