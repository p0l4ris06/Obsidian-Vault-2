# Liver function
[[Ornithine cycle]]

## Many metabolic functions
The liver is metabolically very active and carries out a wide range of functions including:
- Control of [[Blood]] [[Glucose]] levels, [[Amino acids]] levels, [[Lipids]] levels
- Synthesis of [[Bile]], plasma [[Proteins]], [[Cholesterol]]
- Synthesis of red blood cells in the foetus
- Storage of vitamins A, D and B12, iron, [[Glycogen]]
- Detoxification of [[Alcohol]], drugs
- Breakdown of [[Hormones]]
- Destruction of red blood cells

## Storage of Glycogen
The liver stores sugars in the form of glycogen. The glycogen forms granules in the [[Cytoplasm]] of [[Hepatocyte]]s. This glycogen can be broken down to release glucose into the blood as required.
