# Liver function
[[Ornithine cycle]]

## Many metabolic functions
The liver is metabolically very active and carries out a wide range of functions including:
- Control of [[Blood]] [[Glucose]] levels, [[Amino acids]] levels, [[Lipids]] levels
- Synthesis of [[Bile]], plasma [[Proteins]], [[Cholesterol]]
- Synthesis of red blood cells in the foetus
- Storage of vitamins A, D and B12, iron, [[Glycogen]]
- Detoxification of [[Alcohol]], drugs
- Breakdown of [[Hormones]]
- Destruction of red blood cells

## Storage of Glycogen
The liver stores sugars in the form of glycogen. The glycogen forms granules in the [[Cytoplasm]] of [[Hepatocyte]]s. This glycogen can be broken down to release glucose into the blood as required.

## Detoxification
Toxins can be rendered harmless by [[Oxidation]], [[Reduction]], methylation or by combination with another molecule. [[Hepatocyte]]s contain many [[Enzyme]]s that render toxic molecules less toxic.
### Catylase:
Converts hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. Catylase has a high turnover number of 5,000,000.
### Cytochrome P450
A group of enzymes that are used to breakdown drugs including cocaine and various medicinal drugs. The cytochromes are used in other metabolic reactions as well such as [[Electron]] transport during [[Respiration]]. Their role in metabolising drugs can interfere with other metabolic roles and caused the unwanted side effects of some medicinal drugs.
