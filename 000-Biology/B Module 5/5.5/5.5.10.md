### Muscle
[[Cardiac muscle]]
[[Involuntary muscle]]
[[Neuromuscular junction]]
[[Skeletal muscle]]

## Three types of Muscle
Muscles are composed of cells arranged to form fibres. These fibres can contract and become shorter, which produces a force.
Contraction is achieved by interaction between to [[Proteins]] filaments (actin and myosin) in the muscle cells. Muscle cannot elongate without an antagonist. Therefore, muscles are usually arranged in opposing pairs, so that one contracts as the other elongates. In some cases, the antagonist may be elastic recoil or [[Hydrostatic pressure]] in a chamber.
There are three types of muscle: Involuntary ([[Smooth muscle]]), cardiac, and voluntary (skeletal or striated) muscle.
