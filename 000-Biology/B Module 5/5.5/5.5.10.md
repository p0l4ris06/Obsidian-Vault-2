### Muscle
[[Cardiac muscle]]
[[Involuntary muscle]]
[[Neuromuscular junction]]
[[Skeletal muscle]]

## Three types of Muscle
Muscles are composed of cells arranged to form fibres. These fibres can contract and become shorter, which produces a force.
Contraction is achieved by interaction between to [[Proteins]] filaments (actin and myosin) in the muscle cells. Muscle cannot elongate without an antagonist. Therefore, muscles are usually arranged in opposing pairs, so that one contracts as the other elongates. In some cases, the antagonist may be elastic recoil or [[Hydrostatic pressure]] in a chamber.
There are three types of muscle: Involuntary ([[Smooth muscle]]), cardiac, and voluntary (skeletal or striated) muscle.

## Involuntary (smooth) muscle
Smooth muscle consists of individual cells, tapered at both ends (spindle shaped). At rest, each cell is about 500um and 5um wide. Each cell contains a nucleus and bundles of [[Actin]] and [[Myosin]]

This type of muscle contracts slowly and regularly. It does not tire quickly. It is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Involuntary muscle is found in the walls of tubular structures such as the digestive system and [[Blood]] vessel
