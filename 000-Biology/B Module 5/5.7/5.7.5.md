#### The final stage of Aerobic [[Respiration]]
1. Reduced [[NAD]] and reduced [[FAD]] are reoxidised when they deliver their Hydrogen atoms to the electron transport chain
2. The Hydrogens released from the reduced [[Coenzymes]] split into [[Proton]]s and [[Electron]]s
3. The [[Proton]]s go into solution in the mitochondrial [[Matrix]]

#### The electron transport chain
- The [[Electron]]s from the hydrogen atoms pass along the chain of electron carriers. Each electron carrier [[Proteins]] has an iron ion at its core. The iron ions can gain an [[Electron]], becoming reduced 
- The reduced iron ion can then donate the [[Electron]] to the iron ion in the next electron carrier in the chain, becoming reoxidised 
- As electrons pass along the chain, some of their energy is used to pump [[Proton]]s across the inner mitochondrial membrane, into the intermembrane space
