## What is an [[Ecosystem]]?
Any group of living and non-living things, and the interrelationships between them, can be thought of as an ecosystem.
### Components of an ecosystem
- [[Habitat]]
- [[Population]]
- [[Community]]

The role of each [[Species]] in an ecosystem is its [[Niche]]. Because each organism interacts with both living and non-living things, it is almost impossible to define its niche entirely.

## Factors affecting ecosystems
### [[Biotic]] factors
Depending on their niche, the living organisms in an ecosystem can affect each other:
- Producers - plants (and some photosynthetic [[Bacteria]]), which supply chemical energy to all other organisms
- Consumers - primary consumers are herbivores, which feed on plants and which are eaten by carnivorous secondary consumers. These in turn are eaten by carnivorous tertiary consumers
- Decomposers - Decomposers ([[Bacteria]], [[Fungi]], and some animals) feed on waste material and dead organisms

### [[Abiotic]] factors
Abiotic factors describe the effects of the non-living components on an ecosystem: [[pH]], relative humidity, temperature, concentration of pollutants are all examples.
