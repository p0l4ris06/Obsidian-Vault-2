## Recycling within [[Ecosystem]]s
[[Bacteria]] and [[Fungi]] involved in decomposition feed in a different way from animals. They feed saprotrophically, so they are described as [[Saprotrophs]]. The steps in saprotrophic decomposition are:
1. Saprotrophs secrete [[Enzyme]]s onto dead and waste material
2. Enzymes digest the material into small molecules which are then absorbed into the saprotroph's body
3. Having been absorbed, the molecules are stored or respired to release energy

## Recycling nitrogen
Living things need nitrogen to make [[Proteins]] and nucleic acids. Bacteria are involved in ammonification, nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification.

### Nitrogen fixation
Plants need a supply of fixed nitrogen such as [[Ammonium]] ions (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) or nitrate ions (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). Nitrogen fixation can occur through lightning strikes or the [[Haber process]]. Most of the fixed nitrogen is supplied by nitrogen-fixing [[Bacteria]]. *Azotobacter* are bacteria that live freely in the soil and fix nitrogen gas, using it to manufacture [[Amino acids]]. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as *Rhizobium* also live in the root nodules of plants such as peas, beans and clover which are all members of the bean family. The bacteria use an [[Enzyme]] called nitrogen reductase to reduce nitrogen gas to ammonium ions that can be used by the host plants

### Ammonification and nitrification
Ammonium ions are released through ammonification by bacteria involved in putrefaction of [[Proteins]] found in dead or waste organic matter. *Nitrosomonas* bacteria obtain their energy by oxidising ammonium ions to nitrites, while others, *Nitrobacter* bacteria, obtain it by oxidising nitrites into nitrates. These processes are called nitrification.
[[Oxidation]] requires oxygen; therefore these reactions only happen in well-aerated soils.
Nitrates can be absorbed from the soil by plants and used to make nucleotide bases (for nucleic acids) and [[Amino acids]] (for [[Proteins]]).

### Denitrification
Other bacteria convert nitrates back into nitrogen gas. When the bacteria involved are growing under anaerobic conditions, such as in waterlogged soils, they use nitrates as a source of oxygen for their respiration and produce nitrogen gas and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O)

## Recycling carbon
Carbon is also cycled between the [[Biotic]] and [[Abiotic]] components of an [[Ecosystem]].
The carbon cycle is driven by the processes of [[Respiration]] and [[Photosynthesis]] with [[Carbon dioxide]] being the main vehicle for the cycling of carbon between the biotic and abiotic components of the cycle.
Animals, plants and microorganisms respire to release carbon dioxide.
