[[Equilibrium]]
[[Le Chateliers principle]]

## The effect of [[Concentration]] on equilibrium
Changing the concentration of a reactant or a product in an equilibrium system will change the rate of the forward or reverse reactions. the position of equilibrium will then shift.

### When an equilibrium system adjusts as a result of a change:
- If there are more products formed the position of equilibrium has shifted to the right
- If there are more reactants formed the position of equilibrium has shifted to the left
