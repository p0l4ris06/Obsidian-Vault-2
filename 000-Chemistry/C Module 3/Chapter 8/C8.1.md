The elements in group 2 of the periodic table are metals, sometimes called the Alkaline Earth Metals.
Each group 2 element has two outer shell [[Electron]]s. They are in the outer [[S sub shell]]
[[Redox reactions]] are the most common type of reaction for group 2 elements
Each metal atom is oxidised through [[Oxidation]]
Another [[Species-c]] will gain these two [[Electron]]s and be reduced in [[Reduction]]
Reactivity increases down the group as [[Ionisation energy]] decreases down the group
