[[Halogen]]

##### Trend in boiling points
- Increases down the group
- More [[Electron]]s down group
- More [[London forces]] down group
- More energy required to break intermolecular forces down group

##### Halogen displacement reactions

##### [[Redox reactions]] and reactivity of halogens
Each halogen has seven outer shell electrons. Two are in the outer [[S sub shell]] and five in the outer [[P sub shell]]. Redox reactions are the most common type of reaction for halogens. Each halogen goes through [[Reduction]] gaining one electron to form a 1- halide ion. The halogen is called an [[Oxidising agent]] because it has oxidised another [[Species-c]] 
[[Oxidation]]


##### [[Bleach]]
Cl<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) --> NaClO(aq) + NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O
This is an example of a [[Disproportionation reaction]], Chlorine is reduced and oxidised
