##### Reactions of [[Alkane]]s with [[Halogens]]
- Needs UV

##### Mechanism for bromination of alkanes
Initiation: Reaction starts when [[Covalent bonds]] in a bromine molecule are broken by [[Homolytic fission]] forming two bromine radicals
Propagation: Happens until all reactants are used up
Termination: Two radicals collide forming a molecule with all [[Electron]]s paired, stopping the reaction

Makes a [[Haloalkane]]
