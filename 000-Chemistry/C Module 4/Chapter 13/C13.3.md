[[Alkene]]s are much more reactive than [[Alkane]]s because of the presence of a [[Pi bond]] 
[[Addition reaction]]s: alkenes undergo a rapid addition reaction with [[Halogen]] chlorine or bromine at room temperature

#### Hydration reactions
[[Alcohol]]s are formed when alkenes react with steam in the presence of a phosphoric acid [[Catalyst]]
Widely used to produce [[Ethanol]] from ethene
