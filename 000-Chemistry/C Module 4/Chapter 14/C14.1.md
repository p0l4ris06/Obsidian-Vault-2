[[Alcohol]]
[[Ethanol]]
[[Hydrogen bonds]]
[[Alkane]]s are non-polar molecules and cannot form [[Hydrogen bonds]] with [[Water]]. However, alcohols can as they are polar

The alkanes have non-polar bonds as the [[Electronegativity]] of the carbon and hydrogen are very similar, making the alkanes non-polar
The intermolecular forces between non-polar molecules are very weak [[London forces]]
