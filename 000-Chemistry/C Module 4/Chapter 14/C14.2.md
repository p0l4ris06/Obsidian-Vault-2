[[Alcohol]]s burn completely in a plentiful supply of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and [[Water]]
The reaction is [[Exothermic]]. As the number of carbon atoms in the alcohol chain increases the quantity of heat released per [[Mole]] increases also

#### [[Oxidation]] of [[Primary alcohol]]s 
Primary alcohols can be oxidised into either [[Aldehyde]]s or [[Carboxylic acid]]s. On gentle heating with acidified potassium dichromate, an aldehyde is formed. The dichromate(VI) ions change colour from orange to green.

If a primary alcohol is heated strongly under [[Reflux]] with an excess of acidified potassium dichromate then a carboxylic acid is formed.

#### Oxidation of [[Secondary alcohol]]s
Secondary alcohols are oxidised to [[Ketone]]s. It is not possible to oxidise ketones further using dichromate ions
Heated under [[Reflux]], dichromate ions change colour from orange to green

#### Oxidation of [[Tertiary alcohol]]s
Tertiary alcohols do not undergo oxidation 


#### Dehydration of alcohols
Dehydration is any reaction in which a [[Water]] molecule is removed from the starting material. Dehydration of an [[Alcohol]] is an example of an [[Elimination reaction]]

#### [[Substitution reaction]]s of [[Alcohol]]s
Alcohols react with hydrogen halides to form [[Haloalkane]]s. The alcohol is heated under reflux
