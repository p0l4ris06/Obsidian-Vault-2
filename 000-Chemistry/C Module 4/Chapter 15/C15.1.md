[[Haloalkane]]

F: fluoro-
Cl: chloro-
Br: bromo-
I: iodo-

[[Aliphatic]]

In haloalkanes the carbon atom has a slightly positive charge and can attract [[Species-c]] containing a lone pair of [[Electron]]s. Species that can donate a lone pair of [[Electron]]s is called a [[Nucleophile]] 

#### [[Nucleophilic substitution]] in the [[Haloalkane]]s
Primary haloalkanes undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with a variety of different [[Nucleophile]]s to produce a wide range of different compounds

#### [[Hydrolysis reaction]] 
Involves [[Water]] or an aqueous hydroxide
