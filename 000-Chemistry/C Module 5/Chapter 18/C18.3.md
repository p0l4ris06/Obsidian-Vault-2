[[Zero order]] reactions produce a straight horizontal line as:
rate = *k*[A]<sup>0</sup> so rate = *k*

[[First order]] reactions produce a straight line graph through the origin as:
rate = *k*[A]<sup>1</sup> so rate = *k*[A]

[[Second order]] reactions produce an upward curve with an increasing gradient as:
rate = *k*[A]<sup>2</sup> 
As this rate-concentration graph is a curve, the [[Rate constant]] can't be obtained directly from this graph.
By plotting a second graph of the rate against the [[Concentration]] squared, the result is a straight line through the origin. The gradient of this line is equal to the rate constant *k*
