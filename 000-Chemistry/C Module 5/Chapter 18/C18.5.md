## The effect of temperature on [[Rate constant]]s
- When temp increases, two factors contribute to the increased [[Rate of reaction]] and [[Rate constant]]
- Increasing the temp shifts the [[Boltzmann distribution]] to the right, increasing the proportion of particles that exceed the [[Activation energy]] (E<sub>a</sub>)
- As the temp increases particles move faster and collide more frequently
- To react, particles must also collide with the correct orientation

### The [[Arrhenius equation]]
- The exponential factor e<sup>-E<sub>a</sub>/RT</sup> represents the proportion of molecules that exceed E<sub>a</sub> and that have sufficient energy for a reaction to take place

#### [[Logarithm]] form of the Arrhenius equation
- ln(k) = -E<sub>a</sub>/RT + ln(A)
- A plot of ln(k) against 1/T gives a downward straight line with a gradient (m) of -E<sub>a</sub>/RT and an intercept (c) of ln(A) with the y axis
