Both [[Aldehyde]]s and [[Ketone]]s contain the [[Carbonyl]] functional group 
![[Pasted image 20230816130747.png]]
The reactivity of aldehydes and ketones is influenced by the nature of the carbon-oxygen double bond. The double bond is made up of a [[Sigma bond]] and a [[Pi bond]]
Due to the polarity of the C=O double bond, aldehydes and ketones react with [[Nucleophile]]s, causing a [[Nucleophilic addition]] reaction
