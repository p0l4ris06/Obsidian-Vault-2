[[Carboxyl]]
[[Carboxylic acid]]


Carboxylic acids are polar allowing them to form [[Hydrogen bonds]] with [[Water]]
As the number of carbon atoms increases, the solubility decreases as the non-polar carbon chain has a greater effect on the polarity of the molecule

Carboxylic acids react with metal oxides to form salt + water
