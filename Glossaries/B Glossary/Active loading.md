[[Sucrose]] is loaded into the [[Phloem]] by an active process. This involves the use of energy from [[ATP]] in the [[Companion cells]]. The energy is used to transport H<sup>+</sup> ions out of the companion cells. As a result, a [[Concentration]] gradient is created. The hydrogen ions diffuse back into the companion cells via cotransporter [[Proteins]]. These only allow the hydrogen ions to diffuse back in if they are accompanied by [[Sucrose]] molecules. This is [[Cotransport]]. As the concentration of sucrose increases in the companion cells, the sucrose diffuses out through the [[Plasmodesmata[[Sucrose]]]] into the sieve tube.
