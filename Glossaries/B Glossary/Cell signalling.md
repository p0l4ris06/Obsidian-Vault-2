The process by which cells communicate with each other
Allows multicellular organisms to control and coordinate their bodies and respond to their environments

##### Stages of cell signalling:
- A stimulus is received by a receptor cell
- The stimulus is converted to a signal (nearly always a chemical) that can be passed on - this is known as transduction
- The signal is transmitted to a target cell (effector) that can detect it
- An appropriate response is made
