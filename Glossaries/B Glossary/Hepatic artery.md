Oxygenated [[Blood]] from the heart travels from the aorta via the hepatic artery to the liver. This supplies the oxygen that is essential for aerobic [[Respiration]]. The [[Hepatocyte]]s are very active because they carry out many metabolic processes. Many of these processes require energy in the form of [[ATP]] so it is important that the liver has a good supply of oxygen for aerobic respiration.
