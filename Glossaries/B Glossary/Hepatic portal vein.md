Deoxygenated [[Blood]] from the digestive system enters the liver via the hepatic portal [[Veins]]. This blood is rich in the products of digestion. The [[Concentration]]s of various substances will be uncontrolled as they have just entered the body from the products of digestion in the intestines. The blood may also contain toxic compounds that have been absorbed into the intestine. It is important that such substances do not continue to circulate the body before their concentrations have been adjusted.
