A plant adapted to living in [[Water]] or where the ground is very wet

#### Adaptations:
- Many large air spaces in the leaf. Keeps the leaf afloat so that they are in the air and can absorb sunlight for [[Photosynthesis]]
- The [[Stomata]] are on the upper epidermis so that they are exposed to the air for gaseous exchange
- Leaf stem has many large air spaces to help with buoyancy and also allows oxygen to diffuse quickly to the roots for aerobic respiration
