The light dependent stage is the first stage of [[Photosynthesis]] and occurs in the [[Thylakoid]] of the [[Granum]] in [[Chloroplast]]s

### The light dependent stage can be divided into three steps:
- [[Photolysis]] of water
- [[Photophosphorylation]] to produce [[ATP]]
- Formation of reduced [[NADP]] (NADP with two H)

If the rate of photosynthesis is greater than the rate of respiration, any excess oxygen will diffuse out the plant leaves via the [[Stomata]]
