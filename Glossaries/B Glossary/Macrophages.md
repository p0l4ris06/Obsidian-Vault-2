Larger cells manufactured in the bone marrow
Travel in the blood as monocytes before settling into body tissues
Many are found in the lymph nodes where they mature into macrophages

When a macrophage engulfs a [[Pathogen]] it does not fully digest it
The antigen from the surface of the pathogen is saved and moved to a special protein complex on the surface of the macrophage, so it becomes an [[Antigen]] presenting cell

Release [[Interleukins]] for cell signalling
Also release monokines which attract [[Neutrophil]]
Others stimulate B cells to differentiate and release [[Antibodies]]
