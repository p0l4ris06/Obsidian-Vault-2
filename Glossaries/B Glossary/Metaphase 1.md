The [[Homologous chromosomes]], still in their crossed over state, attach along the equator of the spindle
Each attaches to a spindle fibre by its centromere
The homologous pairs are arranged randomly with the members of each pair facing opposite poles of the cell. This arrangement is independent assortment
The way that they line up in Metaphase determines how they will segregate independently when pulled apart in [[Anaphase 1]]
