The chromatin condenses and each chromosome supercoils
Nuclear envelope breaks down and spindle fibres form from the centrioles (in animal cells)
The chromosomes come together in their [[Homologous chromosomes]] pairs
Each member of the pair consists of two chromatids
Crossing over occurs where non-sister [[Chromatids]] wrap around each other and may swap sections so that their [[Allele]]s are shuffled
Prophase 1 leads to [[Metaphase 1]]
