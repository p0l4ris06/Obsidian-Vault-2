##### How it is carried out:
Sample sites inside the [[Habitat]] are randomly selected. Can be achieved by means such as RNG
##### Advantages:
Ensures data is not biased by selective sampling
##### Disadvantages:
May not cover all areas of the habitat equally. [[Species]] with a low presence may be missed, causing an underestimate of [[Biodiversity]]
