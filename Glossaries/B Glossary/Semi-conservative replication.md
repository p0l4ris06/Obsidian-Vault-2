How [[DNA]] replicates, resulting in two new molecules, each consisting of one old strand (parent strand) and one new strand (daughter strand)

#### Each DNA molecule:
- Unwinds, catalysed by a gyrase [[Enzyme]]
- Unzips, [[Hydrogen bonds]] between the nucleotide bases are broken, catalysed by DNA helicase, resulting in two single strands of DNA with exposed nucleotide bases
- Free phosphorylated nucleotides are bonded to the exposed bases
- [[DNA polymerase]] catalyses the addition of new nucleotide bases in the 5' to 3' direction using the strand of unzipped DNA as a template
- Leading strand is synthesised continuously, the lagging strand is in fragments (discontinuous) that are later joined, catalysed by ligase enzymes
- Hydrolysis of the activated nucleotides releases extra phosphate groups to supply the energy to make phosphodiester bonds
