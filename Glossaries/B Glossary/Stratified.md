##### How it is carried out:
Dividing a [[Habitat]] into areas that appear different, and sampling each area separately
##### Advantages:
Ensures all different areas of habitat are sampled and species are not under-represented due to [[Random]] sampling
##### Disadvantages:
May lead to over-representation of some areas in the sample. A disproportionate number of samples are taken in small areas that look different
