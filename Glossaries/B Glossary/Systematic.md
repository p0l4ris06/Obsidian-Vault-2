##### How it is carried out:
Samples are taken at fixed intervals across the habitat. [[Line transects]] and [[Belt transects]] are systematic techniques
##### Advantages:
Useful when [[Habitat]] shows a clear gradient in some environmental factor
##### Disadvantages:
Only the [[Species]] on the line or in the belt can be recorded. Other species may be missed causing an underestimate of [[Biodiversity]]
