In most animal cells, two new nuclear envelopes form around each set of chromosomes and the cell divides by [[Cytokinesis]]. There is then a short [[Interphase]] where the chromosomes uncoil
Each new nucleus contains half of the original number of chromosomes, but each new chromosome consists of two [[Chromatids]] 
In most plant cells, the cell goes straight from [[Anaphase 1]] to [[Prophase 2]]
