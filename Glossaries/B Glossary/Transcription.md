Making messenger [[RNA]] from a DNA template

- A [[Gene]] unwinds and unzips
- [[Hydrogen bonds]] between complementary base pairs break
- RNA polymerase catalyses the formation of temporary [[Hydrogen bonds]] between RNA nucleotides and their complementary unpaired DNA bases The [[DNA]] strand is called a template strand
- A length of RNA that is complementary to the template strand of the gene is produced. This is the coding strand
- The [[mRNA]] now passes out of the nucleus through the nuclear envelope and attaches to one of the [[Ribosomes]]
