Formation of [[Proteins]] at [[Ribosomes]] by assembling [[Amino acids]] into a particular sequence according to the coded instructions carried from the [[DNA]] to the ribosome my [[mRNA]]

- [[tRNA]] molecules are made in the nucleolus and pass out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. One end contains 3 nucleotide bases. At the other end is another triplet of bases called an anticodon which is complementary to a specific codon on the mRNA
- [[ATP]] is needed for [[Polypeptide]] synthesis
