Water is a polar molecule
The [[Electron]]s that are shared in the [[Covalent bonds]] between oxygen and hydrogen are unevenly distributed
This means that oxygen has a partial negative charge (delta negative) and hydrogen atoms have a partial positive charge (delta positive)
[[Hydrogen bonds]] form between water molecules
Water has a high specific heat capacity and a high surface tension
High latent heat of vaporisation
