A plant adapted to living in dry conditions

#### Adaptations:
- Leaf is rolled longitudinally so that humid air is trapped inside, reducing [[Water]] loss
- Thick waxy cuticle on the outer side of the rolled leaf to reduce evaporation
- Leaves are reduced to spines, reducing the surface area of the leaves
- Stem is green for [[Photosynthesis]] (contains [[Chloroplast]]s)
- Can be succulents (store water in the stems)
- Close [[Stomata]] when water availability is low, reduces water loss
- Some have low [[Water potential]] inside their leaf cells. This is achieved by maintaining a high salt [[Concentration]] in the cells. Reduces evaporation
- Very long tap root that can reach water deep underground
