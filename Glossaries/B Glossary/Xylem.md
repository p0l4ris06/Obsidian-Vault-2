Vascular tissue that transports dissolved minerals and [[Water]] around the plant

Structural support

Xylem tissue is made up of four cell types that function together:
1. Tracheids (long, narrow tapered cells with pits)
2. Vessel elements (large with thickened cell walls and no end plates when mature)
3. Xylem parenchyma
4. Sclerenchyma cells (fibres and sclereids)
