When heated together aqueous [[Ammonium]] ions and aqueous hydroxide ions react to form [[Ammonia]] gas (NH<sub>3</sub>)
- Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added to a solution of ammonium ions
- Ammonia gas is produced (unlikely to see bubbles as it is very soluble in [[Water]])
- Warm mixture to release the ammonia gas
- Can be tested by smell or [[pH]] indicator paper. Ammonia is [[Alkaline]] and will turn the paper blue
