## Valence shell electron pair repulsion theory
Predicts the shape of molecules by assuming that the [[Electron]] pair domains at the central atom occupy positions as far apart as possible

### The two types of electron pair domains:
- Bonding electron pair domains: may have one or more bonding electron pairs
- Nonbonding electron pair domains: each have one nonbonding electron pair
