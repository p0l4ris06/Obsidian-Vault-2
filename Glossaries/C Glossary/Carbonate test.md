Carbonates react with [[Acid]]s to form [[Carbon dioxide]] gas

- In a test tube add nitric acid to the solid or solution to be tested
- If you see bubbles the unknown compound could be a carbonate
- Test by bubbling the gas through lime water - Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> 
- [[Carbon dioxide]] forms a fine white precipitate of calcium which turns the lime water milky
