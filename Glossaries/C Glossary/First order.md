When the rate depends on the [[Concentration]] of a reactant raised to the power of 1

Rate is proportional to [A]<sup>1</sup>

In a first order reaction: 
- If the concentration of A doubles the rate increases by a factor of 2<sup>1</sup> = 2
- If the concentration of A triples the rate increases by a factor of 3<sup>1</sup> = 3
