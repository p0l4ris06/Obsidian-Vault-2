In a solid metal structure, each atom has donated its negative outer-shell [[Electron]]s to a shared pool of electrons which are delocalised throughout the whole structure
The [[Cation]]s left behind consist of the nucleus and the inner electron shells of the metal atoms

Metallic bonding is the strong electrostatic attraction between cation and delocalised electrons
