Shows:
- Number of different [[proton]] environments from the number of peaks
- The types of proton environment from the chemical shift
- The relative numbers of each type of [[proton]] - from [[Integration]] traces or ratio numbers of the relative peak areas
- The number of non-equivalent [[Proton]]s adjacent to a given proton - from the spin-spin splitting pattern
