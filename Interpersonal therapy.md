Having relationships, whether family-based, platonic or romantic, is part and parcel of what makes us human. For the most part, these relationships enrich our lives and offer vital social interaction. Relationships are however incredibly complex by nature - and the way we deal with them can have a significant impact on our mental well-being.

Interpersonal therapy primarily focuses on the way our relationships affect us and also how other mental health difficulties can affect our relationships.

On this page we will explore the role of interpersonal therapy in more depth, including what to expect in therapy, the various techniques used and areas this therapy can help with.

# What is interpersonal therapy?
Also referred to as IPT therapy, interpersonal therapy is a structured, time-limited therapy that typically works intensely on established interpersonal issues. The underlying belief of interpersonal therapy is that psychological symptoms (such as depression) are often a response to difficulties we have interacting with others. The resulting symptoms can then also affect the quality of these interactions, causing a cycle. The thought process behind the therapy is that once a person is capable of interacting more effectively with those around them, the psychological symptoms can improve.

The time-limited or 'brief' aspect of IPT therapy means that this type of therapy will always have an end date (around 12-16 sessions is considered the norm) and will focus on just a couple of key issues. For this reason, this therapy is best suited to those with identifiable problems.

# What to expect from interpersonal therapy
The first few sessions of interpersonal therapy are typically used as a means of assessment - allowing the therapist to gain a better understanding of what is concerning you and what you hope to gain from the therapy. Together with your therapist you will then have the opportunity to identify any interpersonal issues you want to address and rank them in order of importance. It will then be a case of working through the key issues raised.

The next few sessions will look to address these concerns in order to understand them better, learn how to make adjustments and apply these adjustments outside of your therapy sessions. To help this process your therapist will offer support in a number of ways, including the following:

- clarification of your issues
- communication analysis
- supportive listening.

In contrast to other more open-ended, introspective therapies, IPT therapy looks to focus entirely at the identified issues. This ensures optimum results in minimal time.

Towards the end of your therapy sessions, you and your therapist may choose to discuss termination issues brought up by the impending termination of your therapy. This is also an ideal time to hone and apply the skills you've learnt to ensure you can cope efficiently once your therapy is over.

# Interpersonal therapy techniques
All therapy sessions will differ according to the individual circumstances, however there are certain techniques that can be especially useful with interpersonal therapy. These include:

- **Identification of your emotions** - For some of us, accurately identifying the emotion we're feeling can be difficult. An interpersonal therapist will look to help you identify emotions from an unbiased perspective.

- **Expression of emotion** - This involves helping you to express your emotions in a more healthy way.

- **Dealing with issues from the past** - Sometimes relationships you had in the past can affect the way you interact in the present. Part of your therapy may involve looking into your past to see if any patterns have formed
