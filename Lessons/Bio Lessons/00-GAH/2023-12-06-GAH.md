# Liver functions:
- Detoxification
- [[Carbohydrates]] metabolism
- [[Proteins]] metabolism
- Fat metabolism
- Vitamin storage
- Mineral storage
- [[Blood]] storage
- Red blood cell manufacturer (Foetus)
- Breakdown of [[Haemoglobin]]
- [[Bile]] production
- [[Cholesterol]] production
- Hormone breakdown

## Carbohydrate metabolism
- [[Insulin]], [[Glucagon]] (Pancreas) and [[Adrenalin]] (Adrenal glands) all affect carbohydrate metabolism in [[The liver]] 
- [[Glycogenesis]]

## Glucagon and insulin
- Released when [[Glucose]] levels fall, it binds to glucoprotein receptors on [[Hepatocyte]]s causing [[Glycogenolysis]] so glucose is released into the [[blood]]
- Adrenalin has a similar effect 
- Insulin has reverse effect when blood glucose rises

## [[Gluconeogenesis]]
- Non-carb molecules e.g, [[Amino acids]], [[Pyruvate]] and Lactate can be converted into glucose in the liver
- Occurs after glucose stores have been exhausted
- Amino acids are deaminated (removal of [[Ammonia]] group) then converted into pyruvate and thence glucose
- Lactate (via pyruvate) and glycerol can also be converted

## Protein metabolism
### Transamination
- All but the essential amino acids can be synthesised from others by the liver

### Deamination
- Excess amino acids have the amine group removed and so they get converted into fats and carbs 
- This leaves a keto group and a remaining nitrogenous compound: ammonia
- Ammonia is converted into Urea through the Ornithine cycle
