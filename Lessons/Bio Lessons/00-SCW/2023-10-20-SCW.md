E. coli respire using [[Glucose]] or [[Lactose]] as the sugar

# Transcriptional level control: [[Lac operon]]
## Presence of Glucose:
- Regulatory gene transcribed into [[mRNA]] and sent to [[Ribosomes]]
- Repressor protein made
- Repressor protein binds to the operator region
- Prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and transcribing structural genes

## Presence of Lactose:
- Regulatory gene transcribed into [[mRNA]] and sent to [[Ribosomes]]
- Repressor protein made
- If Lactose (inducer) binds to the repressor protein it changes binding site on the protein for binding to lacO (changes [[Tertiary structure]])
- Inducer-repressor complex cannot bind to the operator
- Promoter binds with RNA polymerase so that lacZ and lacY can be transcribed
- LacZ is transcribed and makes beta-galactosidase
- LacY is transcribe and makes lactose permease
- LacZ and lacY are part of the same long strand of [[mRNA]]

Lactose permease makes cell more permeable for lactose to get in
Beta-galactosidase breaks [[Glycosidic bonds]] between [[Beta-glucose]] and [[Galactose]] in lactose in a [[Hydrolysis reaction]]
