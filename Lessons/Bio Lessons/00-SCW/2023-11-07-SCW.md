# Transcriptional level control
## [[Transcription]] factors in [[Eukaryotic cells]]
Example: [[Lac operon]] in [[Lactose]]
### Without transcription factors: 
- RNA polymerase [[Enzyme]] cannot bind to [[Proteins]] 
- No transcription of Gene A

### With transcription factors: 
- Transcription factors bind at the [[Distal control region]]
- Genome loops and crosslinks at the promoter 
- RNA polymerase enzyme binds to the promoter
- Transcription takes place

##### Transcription makes **Primary [[mRNA]]**
# Post-transcriptional level control 
- Primary mRNA contains [[introns]] and [[exons]]
- Removal of introns and joining of exons (mRNA splicing)
- Mature mRNA only contains exons
- [[Translation]] to make [[Polypeptide]]

# Cyclic AMP
- [[ATP]] --(Adenyl cyclase)--> Cyclic AMP
- Activates Protein Kinase A (PKA)
- Which Phosphorylates many protein enzymes using ATP
- This activates the enzymes in the [[Cytoplasm]] for metabolism
- Also phosphorylates CREB protein (cAMP Response Element Binding Protein)
- Activated CREB protein then enters nucleus and acts as a transcription factor for gene expression
