## [[Glycolysis]]: [[Cytoplasm]]
[[Glucose]] --2x[[ATP]]--> Hexose Bisphosphate + 2[[ADP]]
Activates molecule, becomes unstable intermediate
Hexose Bisphosphate ----> 2xTriose Phosphate ([[TP]])
Triose Phosphate ----> (4ADP + P<sub>i</sub> --> 4ATP) 2 x [[Pyruvate]] (2H + [[NAD]] --> 2[[NADH]] ([[Reduction]]))
Removal of Hydrogen atoms: dehydrogenation
NAD is a [[Coenzymes]]

## [[Link reaction]]: [[Matrix]]
[[Active transport]] of [[Pyruvate]] from the [[Cytoplasm]] to the [[Mitochondria]].
Pyruvate ----> (Uses NAD and makes reduced NAD (NADH)) + Acetate + [[Carbon dioxide]]
Acetate + Coenzyme A ----> [[Acetyl CoA]]
- Each pyruvate is decarboxylated and oxidised forming acetate 
- The Hydrogen atoms that are removed from the pyruvate are accepted by NAD forming reduced NAD
- Acetate combines with CoA to make [[Acetyl CoA]]
- **No [[ATP]] is produced by the link reaction**

## [[Krebs cycle]]: [[Matrix]]
- [[Acetyl CoA]] from the link reaction combines with a 4 Carbon molecule (Oxaloacetate) to form a 6 Carbon molecule (Citrate) 
- CoA is recycled back into the link reaction
- The 6C molecules form [[Carbon dioxide]]
