If you want a vault with even more guidance and instantly usable workflows, you can download the vault system I use every day for learning and productivity [here](https://johnmavrick.gumroad.com/l/obsidian-starter-vault).

# Vault Features
You can either use this as your starter vault, or transfer the templates into a new vault.

I already imported the required plugins (Dataview, Templater) to use my templates so you can play around with adjusting and importing them into new notes.

## Template Configuration
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/7JMRrskgw7I) to learn how to import and use your templates: 

If the templates don't automatically load upon note creation, be sure to enable the "Trigger Templater file on new file creation" setting.

To choose what template to use, press `Ctrl + Shift + T` or in command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`) search `Template: Open Insert Template Modal`:

```button
name Templater: Open Insert Template modal
type command
action Templater: Open Insert Template modal
```
^button-4ry4

If you manually import the templates each time via a hotkey, then you might need to run a command to trigger the templates (you can manually do it by opening command palette `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and then typing in `Replace templates in the active file`

For example, when you press the button below, this variable <%tp.file.title%>  will be turned into the title of the note (you can revert the change just by pressing ctrl+z)

```button
name Templater: Replace templates in the active file
type command
action Templater: Replace templates in the active file
```
^button-xmh9

the `tp.file.cursor(number)`  variables are just jump points for the cursor, which you can jump to by pressing `Alt+8` or using the command `Jump to next cursor location`

You can try it out by jumping your cursor to the cursor location below:



## Daily / Periodic Notes
> [!INFO] Related Notes
> [[Periodic Review Template]]
> [[Daily template]]
> [[Weekly Review Template]]
> [[Monthly Review Template]]
> [[Yearly Review Template]]

I added the Calendar plugin to make trying out the daily and weekly note templates easier.

Just view the calendar pane on the right side-bar, and click on a date/week to automatically create a new note.

If you want to learn how I use these templates and my overall workflow, you can check my [daily note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFFTIIUDNK4&ab_channel=JohnMavrick) and [periodic note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmNfnkZDWhY&ab_channel=JohnMavrick) videos.

Alternatively, you can see my [newer periodic review system in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUmOKkJq8xw&t=16s)(these use different templates as part of my Ultimate Starter Vault though).

## Book Notes
> [!INFO] Related Notes
> [[My Books]]
> [[Book Notes Template]]
> [[Book Application Template]]

If you create a new note in the `books` folder inside `inputs`, it will automatically import the Book template :)
