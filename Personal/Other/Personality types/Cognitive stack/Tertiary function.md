The tertiary function can develop anywhere from teens to mid-life depending on the person. The tertiary function is generally used to be playful, creative, explore and recharge. It backs up and supports our auxiliary function and often works in tandem with it. The tertiary function follows the Primary function in being either introverted or extroverted, but cannot be the same as the auxiliary function or the inferior function.
