## Contraindications and cautions
### Do not prescribe SSRIs to people:
- In a manic phase of [[Bipolar disorder]]
- With poorly controlled epilepsy
- With known QT interval prolongation or congenital long QT syndrome ([[Citalopram]] and [[Escitalopram]])
- Concurrent use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval (Citalopram and Escitalopram)
- With severe hepatic impairment ([[Sertraline]])

### Prescribe SSRIs with caution to people with:
- A history of bleeding disorders
- A history of mania
- Cardiac disease
- Diabetes mellitus
- Epilepsy
- Susceptible to angle-closure glaucoma
- Hepatic impairment (prolonged half-life) - manufacturer advises dose reduction or increasing dose interval in mild to moderate impairment
- Renal impairment (Citalopram and Escitalopram)
- Risk factors for QT-interval prolongation or hyponatraemia
- Undergoing concurrent electroconvulsive therapy

## Adverse effects
### Possible adverse effects of SSRIs include:
- Cardiac — palpitations (common); tachycardia (uncommon); QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes (citalopram or escitalopram).
- Gastrointestinal — reduced appetite, diarrhoea, nausea (dose-related), dry mouth, abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, altered taste, weight changes, hepatitis (rare).
- Central nervous system — headache, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, paraesthesia, tremor, convulsions (uncommon), sleep disorders, visual impairment, movement disorders (uncommon), serotonin syndrome (rare).
    - Clinical features of serotonin syndrome include confusion, delirium, shivering, sweating, changes in blood pressure, and myoclonus. This can occur when combinations of serotonergic antidepressants are prescribed; most severe cases of serotonin syndrome involve an MAOI (including moclobemide) and an SSRI.  
- Psychiatric —insomnia (very common); agitation, confusion, reduced concentration, anxiety (common), memory loss, depersonalisation, mania (uncommon).
- Skin — rash, hyperhidrosis (common); alopecia, pruritus, photosensitivity reaction, urticaria (uncommon).
- Other — haemorrhage, menstrual cycle irregularities, myalgia, sexual dysfunction (may persist after treatment is stopped), urinary disorders, hyponatraemia (rare), syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone secretion (SIADH, rare), thrombocytopenia (rare).
    - Consider hyponatraemia if the person develops dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, muscle cramps, or seizures. If suspected, stop the antidepressant and manage appropriately.

## Drug interactions
### Possible drug interactions associated with SSRIs can include:
- Antiepileptics — SSRIs can reduce the seizure threshold.
- Antidiabetic drugs — SSRIs can affect diabetic control. Monitor [[blood]] [[glucose]] when starting or stopping an SSRI.
- Aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and antiplatelets — increased risk of bleeding if taken concomitantly with SSRIs. Consider additional INR monitoring with warfarin.
- Carbamazepine — levels of [[Sertraline]] may be reduced.
- Cocaine — possibly an increased risk of bleeding with [[Citalopram]]. Prescribers should enquire about illicit drug use before prescribing SSRIs.
- Grapefruit juice — levels of sertraline may be modestly increased.
- HIV protease inhibitors (for example, lopinavir, atazanavir) — efficacy of SSRIs may be reduced. Monitor and adjust dose of SSRI if required.
- Lithium — concurrent use with SSRI may cause serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In addition, lithium has been associated with QT prolongation and concomitant use may increase this risk. Monitor for adverse effects.
- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) — concurrent use is contraindicated. Fatal reactions may occur (serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome).
- SNRIs (venlafaxine, duloxetine) — increased risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome when given concomitantly with an SSRI. Monitor for symptoms (such as fever, tremor, diarrhoea, agitation).
    - Venlafaxine may also increase the risk of QT interval prolongation if taken concomitantly with an SSRI. Consider ECG monitoring.
- Tamoxifen — avoid concurrent use with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP2D6 and may reduce the plasma concentration of tamoxifen, leading to reduced efficacy.
- Other sedative drugs (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines) — SSRIs are sedating and co-administration with other sedating drugs may have a synergistic effect.
- Other drugs, which if taken with SSRIs may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, include opioids, St John’s wort (avoid concurrent use), triptans, vortioxetine.
- QT interval prolongation — some SSRIs are associated with QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. Concurrent use with other drugs that prolong the QT interval drugs may increase the risk. These include antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, dronedarone, quinidine); antipsychotics (phenothiazine derivatives, pimozide, haloperidol); tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs, clomipramine, imipramine); sildenafil.
- Hyponatraemia — increased risk if concurrent use with other drugs known to be associated with hyponatraemia (for example, diuretics, NSAIDs, antipsychotics, carbamazepine, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin‐converting enzyme [ACE]-inhibitors, and laxatives).
